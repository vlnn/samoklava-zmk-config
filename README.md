# samoklava-zmk-config

samoklava is an autogenerated split keyboard. You may create yours using https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava. This repo though is "just" a configuration for this keyboard. Also it's a fork, not an original configuration, and as such is very opinionated, sometimes out of date.

## What it looks like and why

1. It's a *split* keyboard. This means you may put both its pieces as far away from each other as you like it (not farther than bluetooth could reach though).
2. It's a *wireless* keyboard. You don't need look for any usb cables to use it. (You will need one to reconfigure it though).
3. There's less keys that you perhaps expect. This is OK. Look at the layout below to understand how you'll input letters, numbers, and other stuff.
