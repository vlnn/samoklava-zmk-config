# samoklava-zmk-config

samoklava is an autogenerated split keyboard. You may create yours using https://github.com/soundmonster/samoklava. This repo though is "just" a configuration for this keyboard. Also it's a fork, not an original configuration, and as such is very opinionated, sometimes out of date.
